Lane line detection is a critical technique for the design of systems that allows a car to drive itself. The detection of these lines allows our car to stay on right path and follow it, in the same way that we use our eyes to stay on the lane. This project uses an approach based on image processing, it uses Python as the main language and OpenCV as complementary framework for image analysis and processing.


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
